### Bypassing Rate limiting using Turbo Intruder
Turbo Intruder requires some proficiency in Python, but is suited to more complex attacks, such as ones that require multiple retries, staggered request timing, or an extremely large number of requests.
#### Probe for clues
Observe that after two failed login attempts, you're temporarily locked out.

Send the group of requests again time in parallel.

Study the responses. Notice that although you have triggered the account lock, more than three requests received the normal Invalid username and password response.

Infer that if you're quick enough, you're able to submit more than three login attempts before the account lock is triggered.
